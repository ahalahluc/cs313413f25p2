TestList.java and TestIterator.java
	TODO also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?
	Answer:
	The test results are functionally the same; both ArrayList and LinkedList produce the correct outputs. However,
	I observed that the build execution time with a LinkedList was around 300 ms, compared to 260 ms with an ArrayList.

    This difference aligns with what weâ€™ve learned in past courses: the two data structures have different performance characteristics and memory usage under the hood.
    Specifically:
       - ArrayList provides fast random access (O(1)), since it is backed by a contiguous array.
       - LinkedList requires traversal from the head or tail to reach a given index, making random access slower (O(n)).

TestList.java
	testRemoveObject()
		list.remove(5); // what does this method do?
			Answer: removes element at index 5 (77)
		list.remove(Integer.valueOf(5)); // what does this one do?
			Answer: removes the first occurrence of value 5

TestIterator.java
	testRemove()
		i.remove(); // What happens if you use list.remove(Integer.valueOf(77))
			Answer: I got ConcurrentModificationException error, because the iterator expects to have full control over removals,
			the safest way is i.remove() which safely removes the last element returned by i.next()

TestPerformance.java
	State how many times the tests were executed for each SIZE (10, 100, 1000 and 10000)
	to get the running time in milliseconds and how the test running times were recorded.

	listAccess - which type of List is better to use, and why?
		Answer: ArrayList is better for access operations because it provides O(1) constant time indexed access.
        The elements are stored in a contiguous array, so retrieving any element by index is very fast
	listAddRemove - which type of List is better to use, and why?
		Answer: LinkedList is better for add and remove operations at the head of the list because
		insertion or deletion only involves updating a couple of node references, which is O(1) constant time.
