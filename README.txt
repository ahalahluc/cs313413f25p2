TestList.java and TestIterator.java

	TODO also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?

		Your answer here.

TestList.java
	testRemoveObject()
		list.remove(5); // what does this method do?
			Answer: removes element at index 5 (77)
		list.remove(Integer.valueOf(5)); // what does this one do?
			Answer: removes the first occurrence of value 5

TestIterator.java
	testRemove()
		i.remove(); // What happens if you use list.remove(Integer.valueOf(77))
			Answer: I will get ConcurrentModificationException error, because the iterator expects to have full control over removals,
			the safest way is i.remove() which safely removes the last element returned by i.next()

TestPerformance.java
	State how many times the tests were executed for each SIZE (10, 100, 1000 and 10000)
	to get the running time in milliseconds and how the test running times were recorded.

	SIZE 10
								  #1   #2   #3   #4   #5   #6 	... (as many tests as you ran)
        testArrayListAddRemove:  val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6  ... (fill these in in ms)
        testLinkedListAddRemove: val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6
		testArrayListAccess:     val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6
        testLinkedListAccess:    val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6

	SIZE 100
								  #1   #2   #3   #4   #5   #6 	... (as many tests as you ran)
        testArrayListAddRemove:  val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6  ... (fill these in in ms)
        testLinkedListAddRemove: val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6
		testArrayListAccess:     val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6
        testLinkedListAccess:    val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6
